# QHT

Also variously known as [Hoare Types for Quantum Programming Languages](http://ks.cs.uchicago.edu/publication/quantum-hoare-types-src/) and [Quantum Hoare Type Theory](http://ks.cs.uchicago.edu/publication/qhtt/).

## F* Implementation

Nothing here yet, but to get F* to work, see build setup.

### Build Setup
Setup your build environment using [the Everest script](https://github.com/project-everest/everest#the-everest-script). It is easier to use on macOS and Linux than on Windows.
