\begin{abstract}
There have been several efforts to figure out what kind of static types make sense for Quantum Computing. Apart from a consensus that a qubit should have its own type, it is unclear whether it is possible to talk about specific qubit states such as being in the basis state, in superposition or being entangled. We present a novel system of refinements for qubits based on their behavior instead of trying to find unique types for each unique state.

\section{Statics}
\cite{harper2016}

Syntax of refinements is given by the following grammar:

\begin{equation*}
	\begin{array}{llc@{\quad\extracolsep{\fill}}lll}
	        \textit{Sort} & & & \textit{Abstract} & \textit{Concrete} & \\
			Ref & \phi & ::= & true\{\tau\} & \top_{\tau} & \text{truth} \\
				&   	&  	& and\{\tau\}(\phi_1;\phi_2) & \phi_1 \wedge_{\tau} \phi_2 & \text{conjunction} \\
				&   	&  	& tensor(\phi_1;\phi_2) & \phi_1 \otimes \phi_2 & \text{tensor} \\
				&   	&  	& parr(\phi_1;\phi_2) & \phi_1 \rightharpoonup \phi_2 & \text{function} \\
\end{array}\end{equation*}


Judgment $\phi \sqsubseteq \tau $ means $\phi$ is a refinement of type $\tau$.

The \textit{refinement satisfaction judgment}, $e \in_{\tau} \phi$, says that the well-typed expression $e$ exhibits behavior specified by $\phi$.

The \textit{refinement entailment judgment}, $\phi_1 \leq_{\tau} \phi_2$, says $\phi_1$ is at least as strong as $\phi_2$.
